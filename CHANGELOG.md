# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **OpenSandbox Execution Backend** (`client/opensandbox_executor.py`):
    - New `OpenSandboxExecutor` — full drop-in replacement for `MicrosandboxExecutor` using [alibaba/OpenSandbox](https://github.com/alibaba/OpenSandbox) (local Docker, no cloud API key required).
    - Replicates microsandbox volume-mount behaviour via `sandbox.files.write_files()`, pushing workspace files (client/, servers/, skills/) into the container before execution.
    - Friendly startup check: if `opensandbox-server` is not running, surfaces a clear `❌ OpenSandbox server not reachable` error with exact fix commands instead of a cryptic connection error.
    - `_is_connection_error()` helper for reliable detection of server-not-running failures across httpx/aiohttp transports.
    - `tests/unit/test_opensandbox_executor.py`: unit tests (import guard, guardrails, mocked execution).
- **Configuration**:
    - Added `opensandbox_domain` and `opensandbox_image` fields to `ExecutionConfig`.

### Fixed
- **Monty Executor**:
    - Added `globals()` and `locals()` shims to `ext_funcs` so LLM-generated code that calls `globals()` to inspect injected variables (e.g. `CONTEXT_DATA`) no longer crashes.
- **Recursive Agent**:
    - Fixed RLM instruction pattern: replaced binary `'yes'` check with `FOUND: <answer>` / `NOT_FOUND` sentinel format so the LLM's answer is reliably propagated to output.
    - Explicitly warned generated code not to call `globals()` to access `CONTEXT_DATA` (it is a direct variable in scope).

### Changed
- **Default execution backend changed from `microsandbox` to `opensandbox`** across `config/schema.py`, `config/loader.py`, `agentkernel/__init__.py`, and `config.example.yaml`.
- `create_agent()` factory now falls back to `OpenSandboxExecutor` for unknown sandbox types.
- README Quick Start completely rewritten with three clear backend options (A: OpenSandbox, B: Monty, C: Microsandbox), each with numbered copy-paste commands and error guidance.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- **Skill Evolution (Self-Growing Tool Library)** (`client/skill_manager.py`, `examples/17_skill_evolution.py`):
    - Successful code actions are automatically extracted, typed, and saved as reusable skill modules in `skills/`.
    - `SkillManager` evaluates code quality (compilability, function structure, output quality) to determine if a skill is worth saving.
    - Skill Registry auto-injects available skill listings into the agent prompt so future executions can `from skills.my_tool import run`.
    - Skill Evolution is compatible with all backends: `MicrosandboxExecutor`, `MontyExecutor`, and `RecursiveAgent`.
    - `AgentHelper` extended with `auto_save_skills` flag and `_maybe_save_skill()` method.
    - `tests/unit/test_skill_evolution.py`: unit tests covering skill evaluation, extraction, and registry.
- **Recursive Language Models (RLM)**:
    - New `RecursiveAgent` capable of processing infinite context windows via "chunk-and-reason" loops.
    - `ask_llm(question, chunk)` callback injected into the execution context for recursive LLM querying.
    - Automatic tool inlining for Monty-based RLM agents (strips incompatible imports, inlines server and skill source).
- **Project Infrastructure**:
    - `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for containerised deployment.
    - `Makefile` with `install-dev`, `env`, `test`, `test-e2e`, and `test-all` targets.
    - `CONTRIBUTING.md` with full local setup guide.
    - `LICENSE` (MIT).
    - `.github/workflows/tests.yml` CI pipeline.
    - GitHub Issue / PR templates (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`).
    - `docs/README.md` and `scripts/` for verification and debugging utilities.
- **Testing Infrastructure**:
    - Centralized `tests/` directory with `unit/`, `integration/`, and `e2e/` suites.
    - `tests/conftest.py` fixtures for mocked and live LLM clients, temp workspaces.
    - `tests/e2e/test_live_rlm.py` and `tests/e2e/test_live_vanilla.py` for end-to-end validation against real LLMs.
    - `tests/integration/test_recursive_agent.py` integration tests.
- **Configuration**:
    - `.env.example` template with all supported environment variables.
    - `.env` support — `config/loader.py` auto-loads `.env` if `python-dotenv` is installed.

### Fixed
- **Monty Executor**:
    - Fixed `TypeError` and validation errors when executing code with empty inputs.
    - Improved handling of `pydantic-monty` edge cases (dummy input injection).
- **Recursive Agent**:
    - Fixed `UnboundLocalError` by only injecting `CONTEXT_DATA` instructions when context is provided.
- **Code Generator**:
    - Fixed crash when `required_tools` is `None`.
- **ToolSelector**:
    - Patched to handle broken `torch` / `torchvision` installations gracefully.

### Changed
- `create_agent()` now resolves `sandbox_type` via `SANDBOX_TYPE` environment variable (with YAML config taking precedence).
- README updated with RLM section, Skill Evolution section, architecture diagram, and references.
- `verify_setup.py` overhauled with comprehensive environment and backend checks.

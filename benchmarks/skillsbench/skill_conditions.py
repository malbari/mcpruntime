Skill Conditions Management

Implements the 4 conditions for SkillsBench evaluation:
1. NO_SKILLS: Baseline - no skills provided
2. CURATED_SKILLS: Human-written skills provided with task
3. SELF_GENERATED_SKILLS: Model generates skills BEFORE task (speculation-based)
4. RUNTIME_EVOLVED_SKILLS: Skills generated AFTER successful execution (execution-grounded)

The key distinction between condition 3 and 4:
- Self-generated: Skills created speculatively before seeing if they work
- Runtime-evolved: Skills created from code that has already been verified to work

This module manages switching between conditions and tracking skill provenance.
